ancient-forge=A massive facility which creates the most powerful structures
nexus-lab=An advanced endgame research facility where cutting-edge technology and forbidden knowledge converge. Equipped with state-of-the-art analysis tools and powered by exotic energy sources, the Nexus Lab unlocks the secrets of the universe, pushing the boundaries of science and innovation.
pylon=The Pylon stands as a relic of an ancient civilization, its towering form etched with cryptic runes that shimmer faintly in the darkness. At its heart, a massive crystal hovers, suspended by unseen forces, pulsing with a steady, rhythmic glow.fulgora-solar-panel=The Fulgora Solar Panel is an advanced and slightly more powerful solar panel designed to capture and convert solar energy into electricity with higher efficiency compared to conventional solar panels. It features cutting-edge materials and technology, allowing it to harness more sunlight and deliver greater power output.
living-accumulator=The Living Accumulator is a groundbreaking energy storage device that harnesses the unique capabilities of living organisms to store and release energy in a sustainable, bio-integrated system.
refresher=The Refresher is an innovative device designed to extend the shelf life of perishable items by slowing down or halting the natural processes of decay, spoilage, or degradation. It uses advanced technology, potentially combining refrigeration, humidity control, and even biological processes, to "refresh" items that typically spoil over time.
